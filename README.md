# gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer

gnome-shell-extensions-mediaplayer is a simple extension for controlling any 
MPRIS v2.1 capable Mediaplayer.

This extension will monitor DBus to look for active players automatically. 
All active players are shown in the gnome-shell volume menu by default.

# Screenshots

By default, media players shows up in the volume menu:

Notice the support of playlists in Banshee (MPRIS 2.1 playlist interface).

But you can have the media players in a separate menu (see settings):

You can go to the next or previous track by using the mouse wheel on the status icon. 
You can also play or pause the player by clicking with the middle button on the status icon.

You may also use the status icon to run your favorite media player if no player is running 
(see the ```rundefault``` setting below).

The current track rating can also be displayed and changed depending of the
player you are using (see the ```rating``` setting below).
