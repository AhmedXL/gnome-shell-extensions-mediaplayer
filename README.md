## gnome-shell-extension-mediaplayer

gnome-shell-extension-mediaplayer is a simple extension for controlling any MPRIS v2.1 capable Mediaplayer.

This extension will monitor DBus to look for active players automatically (player names are referenced in the 
metadata.json file). All active players are shown in the gnome-shell volume menu by default.

Tested players :

* Clementine
* Banshee (with MPRIS D-Bus interface plugin)
* Rhythmbox (with MPRIS D-Bus interface plugin)
* mpd (with mpDris2)
* Pragha
* Quod Libet (with MPRIS D-Bus interface plugin)
* Guayadeque 0.3.2
* Amarok
* Spotify
* Nuvola
* and more...

But you can have the media players in a separate menu (see settings):
